# Detecting Physical Social Presence Through Sound

Make the input vector for ML classifiers using make_input_vector.py. 
A wavefile, recorded at 16kHz on a Kinect One microphone should be used.

The two classes for classifiers are 0 (media) and 1 (natural).

Trained StandardScaler, SVC, LR, DT, QDA, GNB, and KNN are available.
